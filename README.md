My empirical study of Kruskalâ€™s algorithm.

Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees, using the fast Union-Find algorithm. Since I will be generating random graphs, I use DFS to verify the graphs generated are connected. I use MergeSort to sort the edges. 

(Note: Write-up coming soon...)
